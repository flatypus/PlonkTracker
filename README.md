# PlonkTracker

A simple Tampermonkey script for Geoguessr players to look for hotspots and blindspot patterns in guessing.

## Overview

The inspiration came from [this Google Earth map](https://earth.google.com/earth/d/1tuyuUutWQv3G25ee6zWUrO-QnjI8CptI?usp=sharing) I created to track where I think I usually guess in games. The idea was that I generally know the differences between countries at this point (Bolivia from Argentina, Japan from South Korea), but beyond that, I really didn't know how well I played within countries. On this Earth map, it's pretty clear that I know Japan fairly well now, but countries like Peru or Russia are basically just plain vibes; I barely know the differences between regions if it's up to chance.

At the same time, I also felt like there were places that I would barely guess at all by strategy; Saskatchewan or Tasmania is a good example. Without a very specific clue for some of these places, my 'vibes' rarely lead me to guess there, leading to 'blind spots' that I completely miss in game. I'm hoping I can use this data to figure out where I'm weak and where I guess way too often, as well as places that I'm constantly misreading.
